# Angular Application

This is an Angular-based application that simulates data loading on startup and displays a table of chemical elements with columns for Number, Name, Weight, and Symbol. Users can edit any record through a popup dialog with an input field, and the table updates immediately after the changes are saved. The application also includes a global filter input that searches across all fields with a 2-second debounce to delay filtering until typing has stopped.
